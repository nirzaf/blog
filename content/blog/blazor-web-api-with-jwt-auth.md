<p>I would like to share a guide on how to implement a JWT Authentication system into a Dotnet Core 2 Web API project that uses Microsofts new Blazor, but this same guide can be used for regular Asp.Net core 2 Web API’s.</p>
<p>If you have not heard of Blazor I encourage you to take a look at Blazor . In a nutshell it allows you to write client side and server side code using just C#, take a minute to let that sink in… This means no JavaScript needed to write UI, well… there are ways to still use JavaScript using the Javascript interop if there are no other library’s available in C#.</p>
<p>I hope you find this guide useful and I will post the source code onto GitHub.</p>
