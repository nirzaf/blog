<p>If you are preparing for a Java-based interview, it&#8217;s a good idea to go through Java Interview Questions. I have written a lot of interview questions articles in Core Java, Java EE to popular frameworks.</p>
<h2>Java Interview Questions FAQs</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s go through some common questions before you read articles that focus on specific areas.</p>
<h3>1. Which is the best site for Java Interview Questions?</h3>
<p>There are tons of websites where you will find java interview questions. So how do you know which ones you should read? </p>
<p>The answer is simple &#8211; read the ones that cover the latest features. Also, read the articles where you can post comments. Most of the times, the author makes some mistakes or confusing statements. Then corrects them through user feedback coming through comments.</p>
<h3>2. What are the popular topics for Java Interview?</h3>
<p>Some of the popular topics for Java interview are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OOPS Concepts</li>
<li>Java String</li>
<li>Collections Framework</li>
<li>Multithreading</li>
<li>Generics</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>Stream API</li>
<li>Lambda Expressions</li>
<li>Latest Release Features</li>
<li>Java EE Frameworks &#8211; Spring, Hibernate etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. What is Java used for?</h3>
<p>We use Java programming everywhere. We use Java to create standalone programs, web applications, and web services. We can create distributed enterprise applications using Java EE frameworks. </p>
<h3>4. What is Core Java?</h3>
<p>Java SE is also called Core Java. It is the set of libraries that are part of standard java installation. For example, the Collections framework is part of Core Java. But, Servlet/JSP is part of Java Enterprise Edition.</p>
<h3>5. What are the advanced Java Topics?</h3>
<p>Some of the advanced java concepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heap and Stack Memory</li>
<li>Garbage Collection</li>
<li>Reflection API</li>
<li>Thread Deadlock</li>
<li>Java ClassLoader</li>
<li>Java Logging API</li>
<li>Internationalization in Java</li>
<li>Java Module System</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Is Java a dying language?</h3>
<p>Java is still one of the most popular programming languages. It’s still the first choice for enterprise applications. There are tons of free open source resources available to help you in Java programming. So I am not worried that Java is Dying at all.</p>
<h3>7. What is difference between JavaScript and Java?</h3>
<p>Some of the key differences between JavaScript and Java are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java is Object Oriented Programming Language. But, JavaScript is an Object Oriented <strong>Scripting</strong> language.</li>
<li>Java code runs in a virtual machine or browser (Applets) where JavaScript code runs on browser.</li>
<li>We have to compile Java source code to byte code before JVM can understand and execute it. JavaScript code is text based and we don&#8217;t need to compile it.</li>
<li>We use JavaScript to perform browser specific tasks. We use Java to create standalone utility apps, web applications, and web services.</li>
<li>JavaScript is lightweight whereas we have to install Java and configure it to run.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8. Which is better &#8211; Java or Python?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s like comparing Apples to Oranges. Both Java and Python are very popular programming languages. It depends on the project whether you want to use Java or Python or sometimes both together.</p>
<p>Here are some inputs based on my personal experience working with both Java and Python for a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>We prefer Java over Python to create web services or web applications. Java EE APIs and frameworks are robust and secure. Python frameworks such as Flask and Django are still evolving.</li>
<li>We prefer Python over Java to create a utility script because it’s more lightweight than Java.</li>
<li>We prefer Python for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence applications. It&#8217;s because most of the popular APIs in these areas are Python-based.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9. Who Created Java?</h3>
<p>Java was first created by <strong>James Gosling</strong> at Sun Microsystems. The first public version was released in 1996.</p>
<h3>10. What is the latest version of Java?</h3>
<p>Java 12 is the latest version, released on March 19, 2019. Now, Oracle releases a new java version every 6 months. So you can expect Java 13 release in September 2019.</p>

<p>Core Java is the starting point of any Java interview. A strong grip on Core Java is must to clear the Java interview for experienced as well as beginners. Java 8 Interview Questions</a></h3>
<p>ava 8 was a major release with many new features. Some of them are Lambdas, Functional interfaces, Streams, and Date Time API. This article will help you in preparing for the interview related to these APIs.</p>
