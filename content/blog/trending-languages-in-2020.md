The year 2020 sounds like it’s derived from science fiction, yet here we are — about to knock on its front door. If you’re curious about what the future might bring to the programming world, you’re in the right place. I might be completely wrong — don’t quote me on this— but here’s what I think will happen. I can’t predict the future, but I can make educated guesses.

## RUST

Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety — especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but it’s designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.

We’ve seen four years of strong growth of the Rust programming language. I believe 2020 is the year Rust will officially become mainstream. What is mainstream is up for self-interpretation, but I believe schools will start introducing Rust to their curriculum. This will create a new wave of Rust engineers.

Rust has proven itself to be a great language with a vibrant and active community. With Facebook building Libra on Rust — its the biggest project ever — we’re about to see what Rust is really made off.

If you’re looking to learn a new language, I would strongly recommend learning Rust. If you’re curious to learn more

## GraphQL Adoption Will Continue to Grow

As our applications grow in complexity, so do our data consumption needs. I’m a big fan of GraphQL, and I’ve used it many times. I think it’s a far superior solution to fetching data compared with a traditional REST API. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.

GraphQL is used by teams of all sizes in many different environments and languages to power mobile apps, websites, and APIs.
