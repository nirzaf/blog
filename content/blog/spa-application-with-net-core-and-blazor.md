### Introduction
<p>In this article, we will create a Single Page Application (SPA) using server-side Blazor. We will use an Entity Framework Core database. Single-Page Applications are web applications that load a single HTML page. They dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.</p>

<P>We will be creating a sample Employee Record Management System. We will perform CRUD operations on it. A modal popup will display the form to handle user inputs. The form will also have a dropdown list which will bind to a database table. We will also provide a filter option to the user to filter the employee records based on employee name.</p>

<P>We will be using Visual Studio 2017 and SQL Server 2017 for our demo.</p>

<P>Let us look at the final application:</p>
